# Implementation

## The Model
The global kinematic model which determines the next state at t+1 from state vector and actuator values at t. 
- The state vector consists in _x_ and _y_ coordinates, orientation angle _ψ_, velocity _v_, cross-track error _cte_ and error in orientation _eψ_ (difference of vehicle orientation and trajectory orientation).

- Actuator values are: acceleration a and steering angle δ.

Update equations:

x_t+1_​= x_t_​+ v_t_​* cos(ψ_t_) * dt

y_t+1_​= y_t_​+ v_t_​* sin(ψ_t_) * dt

ψ_t+1_​= ψ_t_​+​v_t_​* δ * dt / Lf​

v_t+1_​= v_t_​+ a_t_​* dt

cte_t+1_ = y_t_​+ v_t_​* sin(ψ_t_) * dt

eψ_t+1 = ψ_t_​- ψ_des_t_ +​v_t_​* δ * dt / Lf

where _Lf_​denotes the distance between the front of the vehicle and its center of gravity. The larger the vehicle , the slower the turn rate.
ψ_des_ - desired orientation.

## Timestep Length and Elapsed Duration (N & dt) 
Timestep Length _dt_ and Elapsed Duration _N_ define the prediction horizon _T_. The prediction horizon T is restricted by the assumption about the alterability of environment, it could be the traffic density (by lane changes) or road geometry. Since we have no traffic on the given track, the restrictions of environment is based on the road geometry like turn-maneuver or maneuver in s-curves (difficult to fit with polynomial of 3rd order). 

Under assumption that the ego-car drives in curves with the radius not smaller then 50m, where the turn sector with the same radius is at least 15 deg (arc length = approx. 13m) and that ego-velocity < 10m/s, the prediction horizon T = 1 sec seems to be an optimal choise. 

By manual tuning the combination of N = 10 [steps] and dt = 0.1 [s] seems to have a good proportion where there are enough actuations in trajectory to approximate a reference trajectory. By choosing smaller dt like 0.05[s] / N = 20 [steps] the system needs more time for the calculation, by bigger dt like 0.2[s] by N=5 [steps] the car has a higher discretization error to the reference trajectory and the car reacts to late in the curves.   

## Polynomial Fitting and MPC Preprocessing
To simplify the fitting with polynomials before applying MPC, the transformation of the waypoints of reference trajectory to the vehicle coordinate system has been done. So the first waypoint is in (0, 0) with the orientation angle equal 0.

## Model Predictive Control with Latency
Due to latency in the system the commands with the steer and acceleration vectors are provided to the actuators with the delay. This issue leads to overcome = the car drives out of the road. To avoid this effect the state vector has been predicted to the timestamp + assumed value of the latency (100ms) (s. lines 120-124 in main.cpp).
 
To smooth the steering transitions tuning of the penalties in the cost function of MPC have been done.

* Fortran Compiler
  * Mac: `brew install gcc` (might not be required)
  * Linux: `sudo apt-get install gfortran`. Additionall you have also have to install gcc and g++, `sudo apt-get install gcc g++`. Look in [this Dockerfile](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-MPC-Quizzes/blob/master/Dockerfile) for more info.
* [Ipopt](https://projects.coin-or.org/Ipopt)
  * If challenges to installation are encountered (install script fails).  Please review this thread for tips on installing Ipopt.
  * Mac: `brew install ipopt`
       +  Some Mac users have experienced the following error:
       ```
       Listening to port 4567
       Connected!!!
       mpc(4561,0x7ffff1eed3c0) malloc: *** error for object 0x7f911e007600: incorrect checksum for freed object
       - object was probably modified after being freed.
       *** set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug
       ```
       This error has been resolved by updrading ipopt with
       ```brew upgrade ipopt --with-openblas```
       per this [forum post](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/incorrect-checksum-for-freed-object/313433/19).
  * Linux
    * You will need a version of Ipopt 3.12.1 or higher. The version available through `apt-get` is 3.11.x. If you can get that version to work great but if not there's a script `install_ipopt.sh` that will install Ipopt. You just need to download the source from the Ipopt [releases page](https://www.coin-or.org/download/source/Ipopt/).
    * Then call `install_ipopt.sh` with the source directory as the first argument, ex: `sudo bash install_ipopt.sh Ipopt-3.12.1`. 
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [CppAD](https://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/)
  * Mac: `brew install cppad`
  * Linux `sudo apt-get install cppad` or equivalent.
  * Windows: TODO. If you can use the Linux subsystem and follow the Linux instructions.
* [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page). This is already part of the repo so you shouldn't have to worry about it.
* Simulator. You can download these from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases).
* Not a dependency but read the [DATA.md](./DATA.md) for a description of the data sent back from the simulator.


## Basic Build Instructions


1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./mpc`.

## Tips

1. It's recommended to test the MPC on basic examples to see if your implementation behaves as desired. One possible example
is the vehicle starting offset of a straight line (reference). If the MPC implementation is correct, after some number of timesteps
(not too many) it should find and track the reference line.
2. The `lake_track_waypoints.csv` file has the waypoints of the lake track. You could use this to fit polynomials and points and see of how well your model tracks curve. NOTE: This file might be not completely in sync with the simulator so your solution should NOT depend on it.
3. For visualization this C++ [matplotlib wrapper](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp) could be helpful.)
4.  Tips for setting up your environment are available [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/b1ff3be0-c904-438e-aad3-2b5379f0e0c3/concepts/1a2255a0-e23c-44cf-8d41-39b8a3c8264a)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
